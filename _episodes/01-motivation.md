## Testing: you're already doing it... you're just doing it *wrong*

Here's a secret --- no matter how inexperienced you might be, you're
already doing testing code. It's a natural and organic part of the
code-writing process. As you compose, do you ever run interactive
sanity checks on a code snippet (in the Python interpreter or in a
Jupyter notebook) to make sure it gives correct answers in simple
known cases? Or that it correctly loads certain data? Or that printed
output is formatted in a particular way? Mazel tov --- you're testing.

So you don't need to be convinced or taught to test. You already
understand and practice the logical basics intuitively. Instead, we
hope to convince you to *formalize* the testing process and then
*automate* it so that it happens routinely. And we'll discuss
guidelines and practical tools for doing so.

Once you're testing the right way, you will:

> [-] *Know* your code handles doesn't break for certain inputs or operating cases (as
> opposed to relying on wishful thinking)
>
> [-] Have confidence that the correct gives scientifically correct output
>
> [-] *Save time!*
