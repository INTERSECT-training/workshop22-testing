### Black-box testing 

Can you test code that you don’t have access to? Yes, that is where black-box testing can be used. Treat your code as a black box in which you know the inputs and outputs. 

Example: with legacy code. Show how the inputs and outputs and how the pytest is written

How do you find good test inputs and cover the input space?  

## Equivalance class partitioning

Think as an adversarial to your code–how can you break it?

## Boundary value testing
