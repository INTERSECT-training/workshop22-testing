*Using legacy code example
*Adversarial test
*Fixtures

Can you test code that you don’t have access to? Yes, that is where black-box testing can be used. Treat your code as a black box in which you know the inputs and outputs. 

Example: with legacy code. Show how the inputs and outputs and how the pytest is written 

## Equivalance class partitioning
How do you find good test inputs and cover the input space? Partition the input space into non-overlapping 
Add to the previous example

## Boundary value testing
Think as an adversarial to your code–how can you break it?
Add to the same example
